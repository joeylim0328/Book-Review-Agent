       "我最初接触《动物庄园》其实是被朋友的推荐——他是乔治·奥威尔的铁杆粉丝。书的封面总是出现一头猪，直觉得这不过是一本猪仔故事，想不出它跟猪肉行家有什么关系。然而，当我翻开这本书，才发现它比我预想的要深刻得多。它是一部让你深思的政治寓言，几乎任何对政治感兴趣、想看政治怎么操纵人心的人都不容错过。\n",
       "\n",
       "顾名思义，故事发生在一个叫马尔门庄园（Manor Farm）的农场里，动物们被人类农夫残忍对待。动物们被赋予人性，这一点听起来很离谱，但正是这种设定让情节更有张力。庄园的主角是一位不负责任、酗酒的乔恩斯先生。一天，一头老猪——老马杰——召集所有动物，宣扬“动物应该接管庄园、赢得自由”的理念，并让他们学习一首革命之歌——《英格兰之兽》。当老马杰去世后，年轻两只猪——雪球和拿破仑，接管领导权，发动了推翻乔恩斯的起义，并将庄园改名为“动物庄园”。随后，动物们制定了七条动物主义圣旨，最先画在谷仓壁上的七条规则是：\n",
       "\n",
       "1. 一切两足之物都是敌人。  \n",
       "2. 一切四足之物或有翅膀者皆为朋友。  \n",
       "3. 动物不得穿衣。  \n",
       "4. 动物不得睡床。  \n",
       "5. 动物不得喝酒。  \n",
       "6. 动物不得互相杀害。  \n",
       "7. 所有动物平等。  \n",
       "\n",
       "雪球负责教育动物识字，拿破仑则把幼犬单独教导动物主义的真谛。初期，庄园食物充足，事务运转顺畅。然而，猪开始把自己提升为领袖，分配特殊食物——如牛奶，理由是“牛奶对猪的健康至关重要，猪的脑力需要它”，这本是对“猪”的优先待遇，却不见得真是好吃。正是这些细小的偏见，让猪逐渐占据优势，慢慢地，这场革命的理想被腐蚀。拿破仑最终成为独裁者，一只又一只小动物被他用托辞、虚假承诺、加班劳累与压榨。更令人惊讶的是，拿破仑开始模仿人类：睡在床上、喝威士忌、甚至与人类农舍的邻居同桌享用宴席，他把自己和人类联系在了一起，让动物们意识到，猪和人其实并无界限。\n",
       "\n",
       "《动物庄园》映射的是1917年前俄罗斯革命以及随后的斯大林主义时代的曲折。奥威尔通过富有寓意的叙事，展示了政治如何在不张扬的情况下逐步掌控人们的思想与行为，你读完后会不禁反思：我们身边的权力到底在做什么？这一切都埋藏在一句名言里——“外部的动物看到猪、看到人，再看到猪，最终连谁谁都分不清。” 这本书是所有喜爱政治寓言、不想错过奥威尔深刻洞察的人必读之作。读完它，我更期待能深入探阅奥威尔其他作品的精彩与深邃。"

    "I started reading Animal Farm because of someone I know who is a big fan of George Orwell's work. This novel's cover usually has a pig in front, and I have always thought of it as book about a pork butcher. But the reality is far from that. Animal Farm is such a thought-provoking novel that I think everyone who's interested in politics or who wants to see how politicians change people's mind should read.\n",
    " \n",
    "As stated in the name, it is about an animal farm called Manor Farm, whose animals are mistreated by their human farmers. These animals in the novel are anthropomorphic (which might seem odd for many, but it's truly interesting). The animal farm is run by Mr Jones, an irresponsible and alcoholic farmer. One day, a pig called Old Major gathered all the farm animals and introduced his ideology of how the animals should take over the farm and gain freedom. He taught a revolutionary song called \"Beasts of England\" to the other animals.\n",
    " \n",
    "When Old Major dies, two young adult pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and stage a revolt, driving out Mr. Jones and renaming the property \"Animal Farm\". The animals adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism. The original commandments are:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.\n",
    "2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.\n",
    "3. No animal shall wear clothes.\n",
    "4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.\n",
    "5. No animal shall drink alcohol.\n",
    "6. No animal shall kill any other animal.\n",
    "7.All animals are equal.\n",
    " \n",
    "These rules are painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism separately from the rest of the farm. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items such as milk, saying that milk is essential for the pig's health, and they deserve the milk because it allows them to do all the thinking, not because they like it. This action is one of the first few way the pigs used to declare their superiority over the other farm animals. Many things happened in the farm, which slowly corrupts the rebellion's ideal. Slowly, Napolean becomes the sole dictator of the farm, some farm animals are slowly pacified by Napolean's excuses, Napolean slowly does more human-like behaviours like sleeping on beds, drinking whiskey, which violates Rule 3, 4 and 5 of their commandments. The pigs also secretly edited the commandments to introduce loopholes and satisfy their humanlike behaviour. Soon, the animals are all overworked, and be given false hopes and promises by Napolean. Napolean even allied with the humans from other farmers and held a dinner party for them. He explains to the guests that, contrary to what has been told the animals of the farm, the \"lesser\" animals are working more hours and receiving less food. At the end, the farm animals realised that both the pigs and men indistinguishable from each other.\n",
    " \n",
    "According to Orwell, Animal Farm reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. What is very interesting about this plot is how it shows how politics work, and how it slowly pacifies and brainwash the people without them even realising it. It's a brilliant plot to say the least. The cleverness of Orwell’s approach is that he manages to infuse his story with this political meaning while also telling an engaging tale about greed, corruption, and ‘society’ in a more general sense.\n",
    " \n",
    "This is definitely a must-read novel. Looking forward to read more of Orwell's works.\n",
